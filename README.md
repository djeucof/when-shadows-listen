# when-shadows-listen
🧘‍♂️✨ A minimalist action-arcade built in pure JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. An experiment in interactive poetry and balance, where each movement is both survival and self-reflection. You are a spark of consciousness wandering through the void, collecting echoes of lost thoughts — while the shadow listens and slowly follows you.
